exp008: AlexNet, full precision, LR scheduler, ...

exp014: baseline
exp014: baseline

exp020: MobileNetV2, RSQ, 2-bit, torchvision-pretr.  -> not converging fast enough...

exp021: ResNet-18 baseline training
exp022: ResNet-18 RPR, LR 1e-4
exp023: ResNet-18 RPR, 10x LR (1e-3)
exp024: ResNet-18 RPR, 10x LR (1e-3), no 1st iteration non-quant




todo: let's avoid the first destroying training epoch with too high learning rate!!
